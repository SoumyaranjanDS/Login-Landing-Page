-------Login Landing Page-------

This is a simple login landing page I created using HTML and Tailwind CSS.
I wanted to build something clean and modern with a glassy blur effect and a nice background image. It’s fully responsive and looks good on both desktop and mobile screens.

-------About the Project-------

The page starts with a small navigation bar that has links like About, Projects, Services, and Contact.
In the center, there’s a login card with input fields for Username, Email, and Password.
I also added a “Remember Me” checkbox and a “Forgot Password?” link to make it look more like a real login page.

-------Design and Style-------

I used Tailwind CSS for all the styling, which made it really easy to customize spacing, colors, and layout.
The login box has a transparent, glass-like effect with white text and a soft blue accent color.
Buttons and links have hover effects for a smooth, interactive feel.
The background image (bag.jpg) covers the full page and gives it a clean, professional vibe.

-------What I Learned-------

This project helped me get more comfortable with Tailwind utility classes and how to quickly build layouts without writing long CSS code.
It was a good practice for creating responsive designs and trying out the glassmorphism effect.

-------Future Plans-------

Later, I might connect it with an authentication system or make the “Forgot Password” open a small popup.
For now, it’s just a simple front-end design to showcase my HTML and Tailwind skills.
